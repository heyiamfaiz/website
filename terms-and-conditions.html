    <h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>
This website and services are provided by Faiz, an independent Digital Strategist based in India.
</p>

<h3>Using my services</h3>
<p>
By using this site or hiring me, you agree to these Terms along with the <a href="https://heyiamfaiz.com/refund-policy.html">Refund Policy</a> and <a href="https://heyiamfaiz.com/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
If you don’t agree, please don’t use the site or services.
</p>

<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>
I offer website design and digital marketing services. Project details, pricing, scope, and timelines
are shared in writing before work begins.
</p>

<h3>Changes &amp; delays</h3>
<p>
Any work requested outside the agreed scope may cost extra and take more time.
</p>
<p>
Delays caused by missing content, feedback, approvals, or access from your side are not my responsibility.
</p>

<h3>No guaranteed results</h3>
<p>
Marketing and online results depend on many factors outside my control.
I don’t promise specific results such as sales, leads, traffic, or rankings.
</p>

<h3>Payments &amp; ownership</h3>
<p>
Work starts as per the agreed payment terms.
</p>
<p>
You receive full ownership of the final work only after all payments are completed.
Until then, the work cannot be used, published, or transferred.
</p>

<h3>Refunds &amp; cancellations</h3>
<p>
All refunds, cancellations, and pauses are handled strictly according to the Refund Policy.
</p>

<h3>Ending a project</h3>
<p>
Either of us can end a project with written notice.
</p>
<p>
If you cancel, you must pay for work already completed.
</p>
<p>
If I end the project due to client issues such as non-cooperation, abuse, or breach of terms,
refunds will not be issued.
</p>

<h3>Legal limits</h3>
<p>
I’m not responsible for issues caused by third-party tools or platforms.
</p>
<p>
My liability is limited to the amount you paid for the specific service.
</p>
<p>
These terms are governed by Indian law.

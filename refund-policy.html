      <p>
        As a Digital Strategist, i believe in building relationships based on trust and
        clear communication. This policy is designed to be straightforward,
        outlining our processes for cancellations and refunds so you know exactly
        what to expect when you partner with us.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Fees for Service:</strong>
        In my fees cover the time, expertise, resources and maybe a team dedicates to your
        project. This includes strategy, execution, and management.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Best-Effort Service & No Guaranteed Results:</strong>
        I provide my services on a best-effort basis and but i do not guarantee specific
        results. Online marketing are influenced by many external
        factors, including algorithm changes, competitor activity, and market
        shifts Etc. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Third-Party Costs:</strong>
        Any funds paid to third parties on your behalf (e.g., advertising platforms,
        government bodies, software licenses) are non-refundable.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Cancellation Policy (For Ongoing Services)</h3>
      <p>
        This section applies to our standard, ongoing monthly or retainer-based
        services.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>A. Cancellation Within 24 Hours (Before Work Begins)</strong><br />
        If you change your mind within 24 hours of payment and before i has
        commenced any work on your project, you are eligible for a full refund,
        minus any non-refundable payment gateway fees.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>B. Cancellation After Work Has Begun</strong><br />
        If you wish to cancel after work has commenced, please notify us in writing.
      </p>
 <p>
    While you will not be billed for any future work, a fixed cancellation fee of <strong> 50% </strong>of the current billing period will be charged; additionally, while any unspent advertising budget will be returned to you, any funds already spent on platforms like Google or Meta are non-refundable.
 </p>
      <p>
        I will provide a final invoice detailing these charges.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Pausing a Service:</strong>
        Services can be paused for up to 3 months. Pre-paid fees will be held as
        credit during this period.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Non-Refundable Promotional Services</h3>

        From the moment of purchase, the following services are 100% non-refundable: specific ad campaigns, ( e.g. product launches,promtions or event promotions) one-time setup fees (pixels, account setup, technical configuration) and all audits or reports (SEO and website analyses etc.) 
      </p>
      

      <h3>3. Refund Policy</h3>

        Refunds are processed only for early cancellation of ongoing services or a
        verifiable failure of service on our part.
      </p>

        <strong>A. What Qualifies as a Service Failure?</strong>
      </p>


      <p>
        A service failure occurs if we fail to start work within 14 days of the start date, miss a key deliverable without telling you, or stay inactive for 14 days straight without notice. We review all claims by looking at our project notes and message history.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>B. What is NOT Covered by a Refund?</strong>
      </p>
 <p>
      Refunds do not cover dissatisfaction with the creative style, failure to hit specific marketing goals, or delays caused by the client. We also do not offer refunds for issues caused by third parties or outside events beyond our control.
